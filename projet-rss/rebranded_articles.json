    "rebrandedContent": "Interest rates are widely expected to be cut by the Bank of England on Thursday. Most analysts predict that the benchmark rate will fall from 5% to 4.75%. That would make borrowing money cheaper, but is likely to reduce the returns available to savers. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets eight times a year to set rates."
